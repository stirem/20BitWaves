# BITWaves

BIT20 Ensemble, founded in Bergen, Norway in 1989 promotes the performance and presentation of new music through concerts, new music events and hands-on-projects in composition.

The BITWaves app is primarily made as a tool for use in BIT20’s outreach composition program. 

The App is made and designed by Stian Remvik at BEK. BEK, Bergen Center for Electronic Arts, is a non-profit organization situated in Bergen, Norway, functioning as a national resource centre for work within the field of arts and new technology.

The development of this App was financed with support from Norsk Kulturråd,
